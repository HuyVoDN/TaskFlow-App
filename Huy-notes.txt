I say we should have about 5 pages: Login, Registration, Home, Profile and Not Found.
and about 4 functionalities: login, regis, user customization, and logout.

We could implement 2 navbars on top:
    + For not logged in: the navbar will have 3 buttons; home, login, registration.
    + For logged in: the navbar will have 3 buttons; home, profile, logout.

We can make the website more dynamic by adding a fake loading page in between the transistion of login and logout.

we should have user authentications, password hashings with jwt, middlewares so that we could handle a valid session, prevent manually entering a link forcefully.


Add a email confirmation automatic system whenever a new user is created.
